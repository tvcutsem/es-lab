        <h1>Tutorial</h1>
        <p>This tutorial explains how to use the <em>traits.js</em> library
          by means of some concrete examples.
        This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of Javascript
        and of object-oriented programming in general.
        It does not assume detailed knowledge of traits in other languages,
        although this tutorial won't discuss their background, which is
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/es-lab/wiki/Traits#Background:_Traits">explained elsewhere</a>.
        
        <h3>Part 1: An Enumerable Trait</h3>
        
        <p>Say we want to define a reusable piece of code for <em>enumerating</em> an
           abstract sequence of elements. Sure, the latest version of Javascript defines
           a number of useful higher-order operations on <tt>Array.prototype</tt>, such as
           <tt>map</tt>, <tt>filter</tt> and <tt>reduce</tt> operations. But these are defined
           only on arrays. If we define our own datatype, we'll have to redefine all of these
           operations from scratch.
           
        <p>Traits are reusable building blocks. Their goal is to factor out
           a common piece of functionality that can be reused by multiple abstractions,
           regardless of those abstractions' inheritance chain (in Javascript: prototype chain).
           In traits.js, a trait is simply a collection of <em>required</em> and
           <em>provided</em> properties. Required properties are like abstract methods in
           a traditional class hierarchy: they must be implemented by the trait composer.
           The trait's provided methods may rely on these required methods.
           
        <p>Consider a simple <tt>EnumerableTrait</tt> that provides the higher-order methods
           map, filter and reduce given a forEach method that can provide it with successive
           elements of a sequence:
        
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
var EnumerableTrait = <strong>Trait</strong>({
  // the trait requires these properties
  forEach: Trait.required,

  // the trait provides these properties:
  map: function(fun) {
    var seq = [];
    this.forEach(function(e,i) {
      seq.push(fun(e,i));
    });
    return seq;
  },
  filter: function(pred) {
    var seq = [];
    this.forEach(function(e,i) {
      if (pred(e,i)) {
        seq.push(e);          
      }
    });
    return seq;
  },
  reduce: function(init, fun) {
    var result = init;
    this.forEach(function(e,i) {
      result = fun(result, e, i);
    });
    return result;
  }
});
</pre>

<p>A trait is defined by invoking the <a href="api.html#Trait">Trait constructor</a>. This constructor takes as its argument a simple Javascript object literal that describes the properties of the trait. Required properties are defined by assigning a property name to
a distinguished <a href="api.html#required">Trait.required</a> value.

<p>Note that the implementation of map, filter and reduce invokes the required forEach method by means of a message sent to <tt>this</tt>. In the context of a trait, <tt>this</tt> refers to an instance object that will be composed from one or more traits. It is expected that <tt>this</tt> eventually defines all required methods. In part 2, we'll see how this is ensured.
  
<p>You may have noticed that map and filter both return arrays, regardless of the type of
abstract sequence to which they are applied. They don't return a mapped or filtered version of the original datatype. This can be fixed by parameterizing the trait explicitly with a constructor for the kind of sequence to which the trait is applied. Have a look at the completed <a href="http://code.google.com/p/es-lab/source/browse/trunk/src/traits/examples.js">example code</a> to see how such a parameterized trait could be constructed.

        <h3>Part 2: An Enumerable Interval</h3>

<p>Now that we have defined a reusable <tt>EnumerableTrait</tt> abstraction, let's define a concrete sequence datatype that makes use of it. Consider an integer interval bounded by a lower bound <tt>min</tt> (inclusive) and an upper bound <tt>max</tt> (exclusive). We will use the notation <tt>min..!max</tt> to denote such an interval. An interval is enumerable as a sequence of integers from <tt>min</tt> up to and including <tt>max - 1</tt>. Let's define a function <tt>makeInterval(min, max)</tt> that produces instances of such a data type:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
function makeInterval(min, max) {  
  return <strong>Trait.create</strong>(Object.prototype,
    <strong>Trait.compose</strong>(
      EnumerableTrait,
      <strong>Trait</strong>({
        start: min,
        end: max,
        size: max - min - 1,
        toString: function() { return ''+min+'..!'+max; },
        contains: function(e) { return (min <= e) && (e < max); },
        forEach: function(consumer) {
          for (var i = min; i < max; i++) {
            consumer(i,i-min);
          }
        }
      })));
}
</pre>

<p>An interval object is defined as an instance of a trait (since it is created by calling <a href="api.html#create">Trait.create</a>). But an instance of what trait, exactly? It is an instance of a <em>composite</em> trait: a combination of the <tt>EnumerableTrait</tt> defined in part 1, and an anonymous trait describing the properties specific to an interval data type. The anonymous trait is created by calling the <a href="api.html#Trait">Trait constructor</a>. The two traits are combined into a composite trait by means of <a href="api.html#compose">Trait.compose</a>.
  
<p>Recall from part 1 that <tt>EnumerableTrait</tt> provides map, reduce and filter but requires the composer to provide it with a <tt>forEach</tt> method to enumerate the sequence's elements. The interval data type adheres to this contract. For this concrete interval sequence, <tt>forEach</tt> just yields the consecutive integers in the range <tt>min..!max</tt>. The interval data type benefits from this contract: by providing this one <tt>forEach</tt> method, it gets map, reduce and filter for free:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
var i = makeInterval(0,5);
i.start // 0
i.end // 5
i.reduce(0, function(a,b) { return a+b; }) // 0+1+2+3+4 = 10
</pre>

<p>The prototype of the interval object is set to <tt>Object.prototype</tt>. If the interval object is supposed to be part of some collection hierarchy, we could have also made it inherit from <tt>Collection.prototype</tt>. What's important here is that the prototype delegation hierarchy of the instance is completely separate from the trait composition. Both are independent of one another.

        <h3>Part 3: A Comparable Trait</h3>

<p>Let's define a second reusable trait. A <em>comparable</em> data type is a data type that can be compared with instances of itself using various boolean equality and inequality operators. Since most of these boolean operators can be defined in terms of others, it makes sense to factor out the common behavior in a trait:
   
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
var ComparableTrait = <strong>Trait</strong>({
  '<': Trait.required, // this['<'](other) -> boolean
 '==': Trait.required, // this['=='](other) -> boolean

 '<=': function(other) {
    return this['<'](other) || this['=='](other);
  },
  '>': function(other) {
    return other['<'](this);
  },
 '>=': function(other) {
    return other['<'](this) || this['=='](other);
  },
 '!=': function(other) {
    return !(this['=='](other));  
  }
});
</pre>
  
<p>This trait provides four relational operators whose implementation depends on two required relational operators. By providing an implementation of these two operators, a concrete comparable data type "inherits" the implementation of the other four operators for free.
 
        <h3>Part 4: An Enumerable Comparable Interval</h3>

<p>Recall our bounded integer interval data type from part 2. We can define what it means for two intervals to be comparable. An interval <tt>a..!b == c..!d</tt> if and only if <tt>a == c &amp;&amp; b == d</tt>. One possible way to define less-than for intervals is that <tt>a..!b &lt; c..!d</tt> if and only if <tt>b &lt;= c</tt>, i.e. if the upper bound of the first interval does not exceed the lower bound of the second interval. For the mathematically inclined: this definition only induces a partial order on intervals (i.e. there exist overlapping intervals <tt>i1</tt> and <tt>i2</tt> such that neither <tt>i1 &lt; i2</tt> nor <tt>i2 &lt; i1</tt>) but that's OK.
  
<p>Having defined what it means for intervals to be comparable, we can go ahead and reuse the <tt>ComparableTrait</tt> defined in part 3:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
function makeInterval(min, max) {  
  return <strong>Trait.create</strong>(Object.prototype,
    <strong>Trait.compose</strong>(
      EnumerableTrait,
      ComparableTrait,
      <strong>Trait</strong>({
        start: min,
        end: max,
        size: max - min - 1,
        toString: function() { return ''+min+'..!'+max; },
        '<': function(ival) { return max <= ival.start; },
        '==': function(ival) { return min == ival.start && max == ival.end; },
        contains: function(e) { return (min <= e) && (e < max); },
        forEach: function(consumer) {
          for (var i = min; i < max; i++) {
            consumer(i,i-min);
          }
        }
      })));
}
</pre>

<p><a href="api.html#compose">Trait.compose</a> can combine any number of traits. The resulting interval abstraction now reuses two traits, and is therefore both enumerable and comparable. Again, in order to adhere to <tt>EnumerableTrait</tt>'s contract, the interval trait must provide implementations for <tt>&lt;</tt> and <tt>==</tt>. If any of these implementations were missing, <a href="api.html#create">Trait.create</a> would throw an exception. Now we can happily compare intervals as well:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
var i1 = makeInterval(0,5);
var i2 = makeInterval(7,12);
i1['=='](i2) // false
i1['<'](i2) // true
</pre>

  <h3>Part 5: Dealing With Conflicts</h3>
  
<p>Thus far, we have not yet encountered a situation where the composition of two or more traits leads to a name clash. The <tt>EnumerableTrait</tt>, <tt>ComparableTrait</tt> and interval trait all define disjoint properties, so their composition does not produce conflicts. Now consider what happens if the author of the <tt>EnumerableTrait</tt> adds a method named <tt>contains</tt> that, given an element, returns whether or not the element is part of the sequence. It has a very naive implementation (we could speed it up, but it wouldn't add anything new to the discussion):

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
var EnumerableTrait = Trait({
  forEach: Trait.required,
  // map, filter, reduce defined as above
  contains: function(e) {
    var result = this.filter(function (elt) { return elt === e; });
    return result.length > 0;
  }
});
</pre>

<p>If we were to run our code again after this change, the code would break. Why? When <tt>EnumerableTrait</tt> and the anonymous interval trait are combined using <a href="api.html#compose">Trait.compose</a>, this function will notice that both traits define a method named <tt>contains</tt>. It records this fact in its resulting composite trait by binding <tt>contains</tt> to a <em>conflicting property</em>. Later, when <a href="api.html#create">Trait.create</a> instantiates this composite trait, it notices the unresolved conflict, and throws an exception.

<p>This behavior is perhaps the biggest advantage of traits over mixins or traditional multiple inheritance strategies: the fact that name clashes are not resolved implicitly, but are rather recorded as conflicts that must be explicitly resolved by the trait composer. Note that the occurrence of the conflict is independent of the <em>order</em> in which the traits are composed.
Any other ordering of the arguments to <a href="api.html#compose">Trait.compose</a> would have resulted in the same conflict. This is a Good Thing.

<p>So how do we resolve this conflict? In this particular case, the designer of the interval data type will prefer his own, substantially faster, implementation of <tt>contains</tt> rather than inheriting a generic version from <tt>EnumerableTrait</tt>. The conflict can be resolved by the trait composer by explicitly <em>excluding</em> the <tt>contains</tt> property from <tt>EnumerableTrait</tt> before composing it. The tool for resolving conflicts in <em>traits.js</em> is named <a href="api.html#resolve">Trait.resolve</a>:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
function makeInterval(min, max) {  
  return Trait.create(Object.prototype,
    Trait.compose(
      <strong>Trait.resolve</strong>({ contains: undefined }, EnumerableTrait),
      ComparableTrait,
      Trait({
        // interval implementation, as in part 4
      })));
}
</pre>

<p>Rather than directly reusing <tt>EnumerableTrait</tt>, the interval implementor
   reuses a resolved trait that is in every way identical to <tt>EnumerableTrait</tt>,
   except that <tt>contains</tt> is "undefined". What this means is that, in the
   resolved trait, the property <tt>contains</tt> is marked as a <em>required</em>
   property, rather than as a provided property. When
   <a href="api.html#compose">Trait.compose</a> subsequently composes this trait
   with the interval trait, it will replace this required property with the implementation
   provided by the interval trait.
   
<p>Why does <a href="api.html#resolve">Trait.resolve</a> turn <tt>contains</tt> into
   a required property rather than just removing it entirely from the trait? It's always
   possible (although <em>traits.js</em> makes no attempt to verify this) that other methods
   defined by <tt>EnumerableTrait</tt> depend on the implementation of the excluded property.
   In order to maintain the integrity of the trait, we have to express the fact the composer
   should provide <tt>EnumerableTrait</tt> with another implementation of the excluded property.
   This is done by turning the excluded property into a required property of the trait.
   
<p>Sometimes a composer only wants to <em>augment</em> the definition of a method inherited
   from a trait. That is, the composer wants to perform some behavior specific to the data
   type, then perform the generic behavior inherited from the trait. The composer must somehow
   be able to refer to the generic version of the method. Simply excluding the method from
   the trait disables this. To this end, <a href="api.html#resolve">Trait.resolve</a> also
   allows one to <em>rename</em> properties:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
var t2 = Trait.resolve({ oldName: 'newName' }, t1);
</pre>

<p>In this case, <tt>t2.newName</tt> will refer to whatever <tt>t1.oldName</tt> refers.
   However, all references to <tt>oldName</tt> in the trait's methods are <em>unaffected</em>:
   they are not renamed to <tt>newName</tt>. Just as in the case of excluded properties,
   <tt>t2</tt> will record the fact that one of its properties was renamed by defining
   <tt>oldName</tt> as a required property: since other methods of <tt>t1</tt> may continue
   to depend upon the existence of <tt>oldName</tt>, a composer of <tt>t2</tt> must provide
   an implementation of <tt>oldName</tt>. However,
   when the composer now defines his own version of <tt>oldName</tt>, he or she can refer
   to the original (generic) implementation inherited from the trait by means of the name
   <tt>newName</tt>.
   
   <p>Resolving conflicts through renaming is analogous to method overriding
      in classical single-inheritance. Think of overriding a method <tt>m</tt> in
      a subclass as 'renaming' the superclass method to <tt>super.m</tt>.
   
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   
   <p>Now that you know how to deal with conflicts, you're all set to start using
      <em>traits.js</em>. There really isn't that much more to it than this.
      There are a couple of functions provided by the library that were not covered
      in this tutorial, most notably <a href="api.html#override">Trait.override</a>
      and <a href="api.html#object">Trait.object</a> which are mainly convenience
      functions and <a href="api.html#eqv">Trait.eqv</a> which can be regarded as
      an equality operator for traits.
 
   <p>A complete version of the source code examples discussed in this tutorial can
      be downloaded <a href="http://code.google.com/p/es-lab/source/browse/trunk/src/traits/examples.js">here</a>.
  
   <p>If you're interested in the data format used by <em>traits.js</em> to
      represent traits, it is explained
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/es-lab/wiki/Traits#Traits_as_Property_Maps">
      in some detail elsewhere</a>.
      Briefly, traits are represented not as opaque values, but as plain
      <em>property descriptor maps</em>. This is the same format as accepted by the
      Ecmascript 5 built-in function <tt>Object.create</tt>. For this reason,
      property descriptor maps and traits are completely interchangeable.
      If anything, it means you can use <em>traits.js</em> as a simple library for
      manipulating arbitrary property descriptor maps.
